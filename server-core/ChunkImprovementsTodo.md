### Possible Improvements to Chunk Handling

1. **Lock Granularity**
   Right now you lock per chunk position (ReentrantLock per chunk). You could explore more fine-grained locking (e.g., per chunk section or even per block) to improve concurrency if you expect many simultaneous accesses.

2. **Dirty Block Tracking Enhancements**

    * Currently you track dirty blocks as a set of BlockPos. Could you optimize memory or speed?
    * Maybe group dirty blocks by chunk section or use a more compact representation (bitsets or region-based dirty flags).
    * Also, implement a max dirty block count threshold to force a full chunk save if too many blocks are dirty.

3. **Chunk Access Patterns and Caching**

    * Implement an LRU cache on top of loadedChunks to better handle eviction.
    * Add a priority system for chunks based on player proximity or recent access for smarter unloading.

4. **Async Chunk Generation & Loading Queue**

    * Right now, `getChunk()` is synchronous/blocking inside the callable.
    * You can build a proper async loading queue with request deduplication: if multiple requests for the same chunk arrive while it’s loading, only one load/generation runs and all requests get the result.

5. **Background Save Queue**

    * Your saveDirtyChunks runs on a schedule. Could add a queue so dirty chunks are saved sooner or as soon as possible without waiting for the interval.

6. **Error Handling & Recovery**

    * Add robust error handling in chunk loading/saving so failures don’t crash the server or corrupt data.
    * Retry logic or fallback to regenerate chunk on corrupted data.

7. **Chunk Versioning & Migration**

    * Design a versioning system for chunk data format so you can evolve your format later without breaking old saved chunks.
